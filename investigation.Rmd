## Simulations

```{r random_seed}
# set the seed for random simulations
set.seed(42)
```

```{r sample_generation}
lambda <- 0.2
# get a sample of 1000 exponentials with lambda = 0.2
exp_sample <- rexp(1000, lambda)
# get 1000 means of 40 random exponentials with lambda = 0.2 each
means_sample <- apply(matrix(rexp(1000 * 40, lambda), ncol = 40), 1, mean)
```

A sample of 1000 random exponentials and a sample of 1000 means of 40 random
exponentials each are taken with $\lambda = 0.2$.
